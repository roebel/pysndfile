pysndfile
=========

pysndfile is a python package providing *PySndfile*, a
`Cython <http://cython.org/>`__ wrapper class around
`libsndfile <http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/>`__. PySndfile
provides methods for reading and writing a large variety of soundfile
formats on a variety of plattforms. PySndfile provides a rather complete
access to the different sound file manipulation options that are
available in libsndfile.

Due to the use of libsndfile nearly all sound file formats, (besides mp3
and derived formats) can be read and written with PySndfile.

The interface has been designed such that a rather large subset of the
functionality of libsndfile can be used, notably the reading and writing
of strings into soundfile formats that support these, and a number of
sf_commands that allow to control the way libsndfile reads and writes
the samples. One of the most important ones is the use of the clipping
command.

Transparent soundfile io with libsndfile
----------------------------------------

PySndfile has been developed in the `analysis synthesis team at
IRCAM <http://anasynth.ircam.fr/home/english>`__ mainly for research on
sound analysis and sound transformation. In this context it is essential
that the reading and writing of soundfile data is transparent.

The use of the clipping mode of libsndfile is important here because
reading and writing sound data should not change the audio samples. By
default, when clipping is off, libsndfile uses slightly different
scaling factors when reading pcm format into float samples, or when
writing float samples into pcm format. Therefore whenever a complete
read/write cycle is applied to a sound file then the audio samples may
be modified even when no processing is applied.

More precisely this will happen if

-  the sound files contains pcm format,
-  *and* the data is read into float or double,
-  *and* the audio data comes close to the maximum range such that the
   difference in scaling leads to modification.

To avoid this problem PySndfile sets clipping by default to on. If you
don't like this you can set it to off individually using the PySndfile
method set_auto_clipping(False).

Implementation
--------------

The implementation is based on a slightly modified version of the header
sndfile.hh that is distributed with libsndfile. The only modification is
the addition of a methode querying the seekable state of the open
Sndfile.

Installation
------------

via Anaconda channel roebel
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Precompiled packages are available for `Anaconda
python3 <https://anaconda.org/roebel/pysndfile>`__ under Linux (x86_64)
and Mac OS X (> 10.9). For these systems you can install pysndfile
simply by means of

.. code:: bash

   conda install -c roebel pysndfile

Unfortunately, I don't have a windows machine and therefore I cannot
provide any packages for Windows.

compile with conda build recipe
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use the conda recipe
`here <https://github.com/roebel/conda_packages>`__. This build recipe
wil automatically download and compile libsndfile building pysndfile.

via pypi
~~~~~~~~

::

   pip install pysndfile

should install pysndfile and python dependencies. Note, that pip cannot
install libsndfile for you as it is not provided via pypi. To install
libsndfile you should be able to use the software manager of your
system. This will however only work if your software manager installs
libsndfile such that the compiler used by the setup.py script will find
it.

compile from sources
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Note that for ompiling from sources you need to install requirements
listed in requirements.txt file before starting the compilation.
Moreover you need to install libsndfile as described in the previous
section.

If the libsndfile (header and library) is not installed in the default
compiler search path you have to specify the library and include
directories to be added to this search paths. For this you can use
either the command line options --sndfile-libdir and --sndfile-incdir that
are available for the build_ext command or specify these two parameters
in the setup.cfg file.

Windows
^^^^^^^

An experimental support for using pysndfile under windows has been added
since version 1.3.4. For further comments see
`here <https://github.com/roebel/pysndfile/issues/3>`__ as well as
`build
scripts <https://gist.github.com/sveinse/97411b95d36a6b8c430d4d381b620ecb>`__
provided by sveinse. Note, that I do not have any windows machine and
cannot provide any help in making this work.

Documentation

   built/install/test cycle to avoid problems as in 1.3.4

Version_1.3.4 (2019-07-23)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  added support for automatic installation of requirements
-  remove precompiled cython source file and rely on pip requirements to
   provide cython so that cython compilation will always be possible.
-  added experimental support for installation on win32 (thanks to Svein
   Seldal for the contributions).
-  use expanduser for replacing ~ in filenames
-  adapted cython source code to avoid all compiler warnings due to

-  limit size of strings to be written such that the written file can
   always be read back with libsndfile 1.0.28 (which imposes different
   constraints for different formats)
-  better error handling when number of channels exceeds channel limit
   imposed by libsndfile.
-  sndio module now exposes the dicts: fileformat_name_to_id and
   fileformat_id_to_name
