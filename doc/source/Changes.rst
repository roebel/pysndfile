Changes
-------

Version_1.4.4 (2022-03-11)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Fix for win32: improved error handling for PyUnicode_AsWideCharString
   (thanks to Andrey Bienkowski)

Version_1.4.3 (2020-01-20)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  changed sndio functions to all use PySndfile as context manager. This
   fixes the problem that the sndfile remains open when an error occurs
   which may in turn lead to inconsistencies if the sndfile is tried to
   be rewritten in an exception handler.

Version_1.4.2 (2019-12-18)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  fixed PySndfile.read_frames method to properly handle reading frames
   in parts (previous fix was incomplete)

Version_1.4.1 (2019-12-18)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  extended supported commands to change compression level when writing
   flac and ogg files
-  fixed PySndfile.read_frames and sndio.read method to properly handle
   reading frames from the middle of a file

Version_1.4.0 (2019-12-17)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Extended PySndfile class:

   -  added support for forcing to return 2D arrays even for mono files
   -  added method to close the file and release all resources.
   -  support reading more frames than present in the file using the
      fill_value for all values positioned after the end of the file

Version_1.3.5 (2019-07-27)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  fixed two copy paste bug introduced in 1.3.4 1.3.4 did in fact not
   work at all :-(
-  added a check target to the makefile that performs a complete
   built/install/test cycle to avoid problems as in 1.3.4

Version_1.3.4 (2019-07-23)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  added support for automatic installation of requirements
-  remove precompiled cython source file and rely on pip requirements to
   provide cython so that cython compilation will always be possible.

   Seldal for the contributions).

-  adapted cython source code to avoid all compiler warnings due to
   deprecated numpy api

Version_1.3.3 (2019-06-01)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  fixed missing command C_SFC_SET_SCALE_INT_FLOAT_WRITE (thanks to
   Svein Seldal for the bug report and fix)
-  better documentation of sf_string-io in sndio.read and sndio.write
-  limit size of strings to be written such that the written file can
   always be read back with libsndfile 1.0.28 (which imposes different
   constraints for different formats)
-  better error handling when number of channels exceeds channel limit
   imposed by libsndfile.
-  sndio module now exposes the dicts: fileformat_name_to_id and
   fileformat_id_to_name
